The goal of the exercise is to learn how to build a package and understand the magnificence of `PyPi`.

I used this [page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-upload-your-first-python-package-to-pypi/) to get some info about it.

## How to install our first package
```bash
bash build.sh
```
## How can you use it on your python project?
After installing the package, you can use it like this:
```python
import my_minipack
```
